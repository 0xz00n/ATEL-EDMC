# ATEL-EDMC
This is an open beta release of the ATEL-EDMC plugin. (v0.65b)

The plugin automatically sends codex discovery information to the public IGAU discovery database 
(Similar to SIMBAD/Hipparcos/2MASS/WISE)

In addition to sending discoveries to the database, we are now testing public "ATEL" discovery telegrams.
